/**
 * Is an abstract class or interface to be overriden in order to define new
 * shapes. Shapes define the way a given datum should be rendered, they are
 * the smallest unit of rendering into a timeline.
 *
 * All the life cycle of `Shape` instances is handled into the `Layer` instance
 * they are attach to. As a consequence, they should be mainly considered as
 * private objects. The only place they should be interacted with is in `Behavior`
 * definitions, to test which element of the shape is the target of the
 * interaction and define the interaction according to that test.
 *
 * Depending of its implementation a `Shape` can be used along with `entity` or
 * `collection` data type. Some shapes are then created to use data considered
 * as a single entity (Waveform, TracePath, Line), while others are defined to
 * be used with data seen as a collection, each shape rendering a single entry
 * of the collection. The shapes working with entity type data should therefore
 * be used in an `entity` configured `Layer`. Note that if they are registered
 * as "commonShape" in a `collection` type `Layer`, they will behave the exact
 * same way. These kind of shapes are noted: "entity shape".
 *
 * ### Available `collection` shapes:
 * - Marker / Annotated Marker
 * - Segment / Annotated Segment
 * - Dot
 * - TraceDots
 *
 * ### Available `entity` shapes:
 * - Line
 * - Tick (for axis)
 * - Waveform
 * - TracePath
 * - Matrix
